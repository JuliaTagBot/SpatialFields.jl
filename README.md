[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rdeits/SpatialFields.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rdeits/SpatialFields.jl) [![codecov.io](https://codecov.io/github/rdeits/SpatialFields.jl/coverage.svg?branch=master)](https://codecov.io/github/rdeits/SpatialFields.jl?branch=master)

This package implements algorithms to construct and evaluate scalar and vector fields. It currently includes a pure-Julia implementation of the Hermite Radial Basis Function scalar field used in graphics applications and described [here by Vailant et al](http://rodolphe-vaillant.fr/?e=12A.), as well as tools to work with polynomial scalar and vector fields.
